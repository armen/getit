Getit, simplified, yet powerful download manager.

Getit is a daemon to manage concurrent URL downloads with wget.
It uses very simple but powerful queue mechanism to download
any URL that get pasted in queue file.
Queue file is a simple text file that accepts not only URLs
but also download subdirectory and download rate.
Getit monitors the queue file and detects any changes that
made in queue file, and determine if its necessary to
terminate any download that is in progress or not, so it
ignores any changes that is not related to in progress
downloads.
Getit is capable of detecting broken links and push those
to end of the queue.
Getit downloads all URLs to a temporary directory and moves
those to target subdirectory after completion.

=== Installation ===

1) To install run ./install.sh script as root user
2) Modify /etc/default/getit.cfg and set DAEMON_USER
3) (optional) Set DOWNLOAD_DIR, QUEUE, LIMIT_RATE, etc
4) (optional) To overide /etc/default/getit.cfg file,
   you can create ~/.getitrc, beware that you can't overide
   DAEMONUSER anyway
5) And finally start the daemon ./etc/init.d/getit start

=== Usage ===

Paste URL in queue file. You can specify save path and download
rate straight after pasted URL.

This is sample queue file format

http://example.org/blahblah.tar.gz foo 3k
http://example.org/blahblah3.tar.gz bar/baz 2k

It will download first file in $DOWNLOAD_DIR/foo directory with
3k limit rate and second one in $DOWNLOAD_DIR/bar/baz/ directory
with 2k limit rate.

=== getitctl ===

If you don't want to touch queue file, you can use getitctl to
manage it.

Following command adds a URL at the beginning of the queue

$getitctl push http://example.org/url path 20k OR $getitctl p ...

And following command adds a URL at the end of queue

$getitctl queue http://example.org/url path 20k OR $getitctl q ...

To stop or suspend downloading run

$getitctl stop OR $getitctl sp

And to start it again run

$getitctl start OR $getitctl go

To get current status of downloading URLs, run

$getitctl status OR $getitctl st

To follow above status use following command

$getitctl watch-status OR $getitctl ws

=== Removeing ===

To remove getit execute following command as root

./install.sh remove
